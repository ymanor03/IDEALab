An absence is excused if you let your project leaders know 4 days in advance that you’ll be missing the meeting for any reason, and you are expected to make up any relevant work. Excused absences also include family emergencies and medical issues. 

After 2 unexcused absences to lab meetings (including weekly meetings with your team and bi-weekly meetings with the whole lab), your project leaders will reach out to see how things are going and let you know that you have one unexcused absence left for the semester. 

Once you are absent a third time (unexcused), the Co-directors and the head professor will be notified of your absence and will reach out to see how things are going. Ultimately, Prof. Intriligator will make the final decision on whether it is best for you to stay or leave. 

You will always be welcome to apply next semester, and we will be sure to welcome you back given we need more members/your expertise.

IMPORTANT: We always expect you to notify your leaders if you cannot make it to a meeting, excused or unexcused. If we don’t hear anything from you, it will count as an unexcused absence.
