There are two types of Project Leaders: Project Leads and Project Coordinators. Project Leads determine the vision and goals for the team. Project Coordinators come up with the schedules, assign tasks using Trello, and check in with members to make sure that they are able to complete their tasks or reach out for help as needed. Each project will have a leadership team of two to three people with at least one Project Lead and one Project Coordinator. These roles are not strict boundaries. They are merely guidelines that we have laid out to help the leaders stay organized. We encourage each team to be flexible throughout the semester and to do whatever they find works best.


Being a Project leader is a serious commitment of 4-5 hours of work a week including weekly meetings every Saturday morning. These alternate each week between full lab meetings (in-person, 574) with all of the members and project leader meetings (Zoom). Project leaders will also organize their own weekly team meetings to work with their teams.
